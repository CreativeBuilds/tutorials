Alright, I've gone ahead and opened up our web page in Brave.

First thing you'll notice is that the position of the text has changed, and this is because of the margin we added.

If you're using brave, press ctrl + shift + i to open up the console.

Click on this elements tab in order to view the html live.

If we press ctrl + shift + c or click this button up here that looks like a cursor in a box, then we can select an element.

As you move your cursor along the page, you'll see that the page changes colors. 

This is the element you currently are selected, it may have a tool tip like the one our title here that gives some extra information.

You can see the width and height, color, font, margin and more.

Now notice the orange area around the blue area.

The blue area is considered the actual element where it's content resides.

The orange is the margin. Keen eyes will have picked up that we only added margin on two sides but now theres margin on three sides.

That's because some HTML elements will have css added to them by default. 

If you want to get rid of it, you can over-ride the original css by adding your own!

But lets say that you want to edit this page, without having to go through the hassel of editing your file just to test some new css.

Luckily for us, we can edit the css within these panels here and even toggle on and off certain properties all together.

Mess around and remember to just have fun!

That's it for this episode of Intro to web development.

Thank you for watching!

New episodes come out monday and wednesday at 8PM Eastern Standard Time.
