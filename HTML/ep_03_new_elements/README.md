### HTML New Elements

Episode Overview / Main points
- Introduction 
  - cover that we'll be talking about adding new content to the page and that this may be a longer episode with a  little more content than the previous episodes
  - I'll say something about how I want to show people the way I learn, that way if they have questions they're in a better position to be able to find it themselves/they know where to look.
  - *cuts to a completed version of what the site looks like from the end of last episode* give a brief overview of what we did last episode (include highlight points from ep 2)
- New Content
  - *cut back to index.html* First thing will be adding a static logo. Explain the img tag and use refrences to get more information about how it works. 
  - Let the viewers know that if they want to learn more about different HTML tags that theres too much to cover and I'm just going to go over the absolute basics for a more indepth list you can view them by going to the w3schools link in the description, though if they have questions about a specific one to leave it in the comments below and I'll make a video about it in the future. https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/default.ASP 
  - The logo will be waaayy to big by default and we'll need to make it smaller. After adding an ID to the image, cuts to css where I add the width and height variables.
  - After showing that it gets smaller, I'll make a comment on how it doesnt yet look like my youtube logo and that's a circle https://i.imgur.com/JXH7wKm.png.
  - The way to create the circle is by using a border radius, please include relevant information about border radius from mozilla https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius
- Centering
  - No site has all their content on the left side like that. An easy way to help modernize is centering your content on the screen. You see this all over now-a-days and don't think about it most likely but reddit is a great example, compare reddit.com with old.reddit.com or on twitter how they center the feed.

  - In order to center our content we need to first "wrap" what we have. Take the title and the image and put inside the div, explain the div's comment and expand on it if you feel like its needed.
  - after adding the class swap to `main.css` and explain the different comments within the .centered
- Outro
  - Sum up what we did
  - Next episode will be about user interactions!
  - Feel free to research buttons and other elements ahead of next episode and then check back in for a progress review!
