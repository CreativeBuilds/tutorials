### HTML User Interactions

Episode Overview / Main points
  - Intro "Welcome to Intro to Web Development..."
  - Explain how we're building on top of the last episode and now we're going to manipulate the DOM. (Nicole: DOM is a new word, it will need some more context so research and go into further depth, but basically its what we've been calling the HTML Tags, the DOM is all those tags together kind of like a tree)
  - Getting started
    - starting with adding text, pretty simple but it will bring about some new concepts that are important
    - add a new p tag inbetween the h1 tag and button tag and add an ID of "clicktext"
    - inside of tag will be empty for now, we'll add text with javascript
    - change the function name in the onclick attribute to get_text()
  -Javascript
    - swap to main.js file and create a new function named get_text()
    - step through the function and explain both lines
  -Testing First Function
    - Load the page, click the button
    - if the text does appear, hurray it works, if not check the console (ctrl + shift + i) for errors. 
  -Back to Javascript
    - Showing more advanced example, we can also randomize the color of the font
    - I'm not going to go over the specifics of the more advanced code this episode (Note: Speaking about the random(min, max) function)
    - continue explination through comments in main.js file
  -Test button again
    -reload webpage after saving the changes, now when you click the button you should
  -Wrap up
