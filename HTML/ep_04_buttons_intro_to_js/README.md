### HTML User Interactions

Episode Overview / Main points
  - Intro "Welcom to Intro to Web Development..."
  - Explaining how you can make sites with just html or css but they'll be static. In order for them to not be static the user needs to be able to *interact* with the website
  - Getting started
    - removing unneeded code from last episode before adding a button below the h1 tag
    - starting off with no onclick attribute, read first comment
    - add onclick attributes and set it to be 'run_hello_world()' this is a function in javascript that we have yet to make
    - Javascript is neeeded for most user interaction and it's almost impossible to make a functional site without it today
    - Add first script tag and use comments above it for context
  -Javascript
    - add the keyword function and the name we used in the HTML file, in this case "run_hello_world()"
    - dont forget the parantheses and then add curly brackets. 
    - parantheses are where any input variables if we had them would go
    - the curly brackets are where any code that will be run when this function is called goes. If you put anything outside of this it wont run when you call the function.
    - for now lets do a basic console.log("Hello World")
      - here we're accessing something called "The Console class" and then we run a **function** called *log* It lets you see anything you pass into in the console, in this case we're using a **string** which you is denoted by the user of either single quotes or double quotes.
    - Load up the webpage, and open the console by pressing ctrl + shift + i and hitting the console tab
    - Pressing the button you should see "Hello world" in the console, if you see a red error, read what it says and it will most likely tell you whats going wrong with your code. If you're not sure leave a comment in the description for help
    
  -Other ways of using Javascript
    -inline scripting can also be done in html
    -inline scripting does link to an external javascript file because you put all the javascript inside the tags like you would text in a paragraph tag
    -lets add the same function as in the other file but change the name to see that it still works
  -Wrap up
    - cover everything we learned
