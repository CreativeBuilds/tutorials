Hello World!

Welcome to another episode of Into to Web Dev 101 I'm your host, CreativeBuilds.

In the last video, we covered all the basic concepts we need to know before starting any web development.

Now it’s time for the real stuff.

In HTML, we make use of things called “tags.”

HTML tags are the keywords used in a web page that define how your web browser must format and display the content.

Think of these tags as the 2x4's in your house which makes the basis for how it should be shaped.

Before anything else, you’ll want to pick out a good IDE that’s up to your tastes

We have to start the whole thing with an <HTML> tag. This tag defines the whole document as an HTML file.

Most tags must have two parts, an opening and a closing part. 

For example, <html> is the opening tag and </html> is the closing tag. 

Next, we insert the <head> tag. 

This contains any code that is not used to display elements on the webpage. Which means that this area is considered as a storage area for metadata, not visual content.

Then we insert the <link> tag. This tag is used as a link to the external style sheets.

We write the tag like this because it contains attributes which reference our main CSS file.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="./main.css"/> 

We’ll elaborate on this part later.
Now we’re done with the head section of our code. Don't forget to close it. </head>

It’s time to start on the body. Use this opening tag <body> to indicate the beginning of the section.

The body is where the content of the document is placed.

This includes any visual content like text, images, or videos.

Here’s where we can input a heading.

The <h1> to <h6> tags are used to define HTML headings.

<h1> produces the biggest text indicating the most important heading. 

<h6> produces the smallest text suitable for a heading and indicates the least important one.

So for this document, let’s use H1.

Start with the opening tag <h1> and insert the text that you want to be displayed on your heading.

In this case, let’s put in the words “Hello World!”

Fun fact: the words “Hello World” came from the book ”C Programming Language” written by Brian Kernighan.

He was asked why he came up with those words and he answered that he wasn’t really sure and all he remembers is that he had seen a cartoon that showed an egg and a chick and the chick was saying, “Hello, World.”

Back to our code, don’t forget to put the closing tag on the heading.

We’re not putting anything else into the code yet so let’s close the body part of our script with </body>

For now, that’s it for our HTML file.

Put the closing tag </html> and let’s move on to our linked stylesheet.

Since we’re through with HTML, the structure of our house, it’s time to splash some paint on with CSS.


We start with indicating the word body to indicate where this part of the script is applicable.

The body corresponds to the <body> tag in the html file and will affect the content inside of the tags the way we describe it here in the CSS file.

To give you a clear image, let's put background-color to define the color of the body’s background.

Colors can be described in either hex, which is 0-9 and a-f, or rgba "Red green blue alpha/opacity.

For this webpage, we will be setting the background to black by simply typing in #000000

This is how it is represented in hex.

Then we set the text color to white.

In rgba, this is how you do it.

color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)

Always remember to put a semicolon when you end a line of code, otherwise, it wouldn’t be applied in the output and may cause some errors for your page.

Let’s stop there for now in our CSS script.

Add a closing curly bracket, aaaand there you go.

Alright, let’s see what we came up with.

Here is how the site looks with our present script.

And that’s it for today!

In the next episode of Webdev 101, we’ll continue building our website and we’ll be talking more about adding images and making a more stylized website.

Get ready for a more in-depth CSS tutorial!
